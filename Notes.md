stats & shipyard hunting

if someone hordes halite,go storm his shit with empty ships and no
strict collision testing...

num shipyard not just depend on time also on how many ships/yards
dont go 2/18 at the end...

update state.py one submit at a time

more efficient mining esp at start - stay on sites with hal a little longer?
= lower interest rate?

shipyard - only if we have ships to spare hunt the guy with the closest score
preference to people who are ahead of us. as the end nears, hunt no matter how
many ships we have (to some degree)

SHIPYARD PROTECTION

add "guards" to the final shipyard in endgame, so this is protected well?

STATS & minor advantages
opp collision avoidance stats to guess strategy
kamikaze opponents

SHIPYARD ATTACKS - TRADING SHIPS FOR MONEY

endgame strategy
trade ships for money at the end - bombard dudes with a bunch of dough but no
ships and force them to spend the money...
protection from bunch of dudes coming at your yard at the end...

keep track of kamikaze opponents - if they get too close to yard again, spawn
and fifo for that yard

make sure fifo spawns dont cost you at the end of the game...

send some dudes to opponent shipyard to just hang around and pick off ships
send a fleet of dudes to mess with him - part of bounties...

manage opponent yard reward blackouts in better way

making use of efficient halite regeneration / mining

hunting is disruptive to their mining... its important even if you dont
actually get the ships...

emergency converts

what happens if you get possible moves first and then find the best target
whose distance decreases with this move?

make a hyperparams file and have a script battle against each other
training environment type of thing...
